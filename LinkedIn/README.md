The Java code converts the LinkedIn .txt files into ElasticSearch compliant JSON.


1. Using the Java code, data to json conversion should take approximately ~2 hours on Desktop.
2. Using the Python code, it should take ~36 hours. 

I highly recommend using the Java code. If anyone wants to optimize the Python code, go ahead.  

## Necessary Steps

Change lines 22 to the directory where the .txt files are located

Change line 39 to where you want the output files to be. Make sure that the directory exists.
