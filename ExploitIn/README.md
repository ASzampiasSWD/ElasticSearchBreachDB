## Description

The Java code converts the Exploit.in .txt files into ElasticSearch compliant JSON.

Using the Java code, data to json conversion should take approximately <b>15 hours and 40 mins</b> on Desktop.
  
## Necessary Steps

Change line <b>18</b> to the directory where the .txt files are located

Change line <b>33</b> to where you want the output files to be. Make sure that the directory exists.

## Stats 

The ExploitIn dump contains 795,304,487 email/password records. 

A total of 11,361 JSON files will be generated. Each file contains 70,001 records.

## File Manipulation
