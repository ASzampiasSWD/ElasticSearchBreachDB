## Description

The Java code converts the Exploit.in .txt files into ElasticSearch compliant JSON.

1. Using the Java code, data to json conversion should take approximately 1 hour 44 mins on Desktop.
  
## Necessary Steps

Change line <b>22</b> to the directory where the .txt files are located

Change line <b>39</b> to where you want the output files to be. Make sure that the directory exists.

## Stats 

The ExploitIn dump contains XNumber email/password records. 

A total of 2834 JSON files will be generated. Each file contains 14,500 records.

## File Manipulation

I did not include any records that did not have an email.
